# LH25_jetflav
Repository for Les Houches 2025 followup studies on jet flavour algorithms.
One question that remained is: how universal are the b and c jets as defined by each of the algorithms? 

In experiments, we really want to recognize a b jet only by its constituents - otherwise we cannot calibrate our tagging methods reliably (if how we tag depends on the process that created jet, then every process needs its own, separate calibration; this simply cannot, and will not be done). 

Questions that Radek (me) thinks we could try and anwser:
> With new labels, is it easier, or harder to tag b vs c vs light?
> To what extent is the substructure of a b or c jet dependent on the process that they come from? Are we increasing or decreasing this dependence by using IRC safe flavour labels?

Ideally, we would conclude how to reach the most universal b and c jet labels, perhaps even selecting the currently arbitrary parameters of the algorithms to optimize.

So far, (at Les Houches), I tested b and c jet tagging based solely on the substructure as encoded on the Lund Tree. No vertex information is included in this.
