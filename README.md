# LH25_jetflav
Repository for Les Houches 2025 followup studies on jet flavour algorithms.
One question that remained is: how universal are the b and c jets as defined by each of the algorithms? 

In experiments, we really want to recognize a b jet only by its constituents - otherwise we cannot calibrate our tagging methods reliably (if how we tag depends on  the process around the jet, then every process needs its own calibration). To what extent is the substructure of a b or c jet dependent on the process that they come from? Ideally, we could conclude how to reach the most universal b and c jet labels, perhaps even selecting the currently arbitrary parameters of the algorithms.
